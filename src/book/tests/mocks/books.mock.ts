            "shortDescription": "Enterprise OSGi shows a Java developer how to develop to the OSGi Service Platform Enterprise specification, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular enterprise applications. Enterprise OSGi addresses several shortcomings of existing enterprise platforms, such as allowing the creation of better maintainable and extensible applications, and provide a simpler, easier-to-use, light-weight solution to enterprise software development.",
            "longDescription": "A good application framework greatly simplifies a developer's task by providing reusable code modules that solve common, tedious, or complex tasks. Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the framework will be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.",

            "longDescription": "MongoDB is a document-oriented database that's highly scalable and delivers very high-performance, especially with massive data sets that need to be spread across multiple servers. It blends the things you expect with any database   like indexing, querying, and high availability   with powerful new features like easy horizontal scaling (\"auto-sharding\"), map/reduce aggregation, and a flexible document data model to support dynamic schemas.    MongoDB In Action is a comprehensive guide to MongoDB for application developers. The book begins by explaining what makes MongoDB unique and describing its ideal use cases. A series of tutorials designed for MongoDB mastery then leads into detailed examples for leveraging MongoDB in e-commerce, social networking, analytics, and other common applications.    Along the way, all of MongoDB's major features are covered, including:        * Indexes and explain plans for efficient queries      * Atomic operations for managing simple data structures and manipulating complex, rich documents      * GridFS for storing and managing large binary objects (images, videos, etc.) in MongoDB      * Map-reduce for custom aggregations and reporting      * Master-slave replication and replica sets for automated failover      * Auto-sharding for automated horizontal scaling    The handy reference section on schema design patterns will help ease the transition from the relational data model of SQL to MongoDB's document-based data model. The numerous, detailed examples are implemented in Ruby and include comprehensive explanations.    MongoDB has been gaining traction in the developer community for its speed, flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. With production deployments that include SourceForge, Foursquare, and Shutterfly, MongoDB is proving to be a robust and reliable database system that keeps developers happy. Covering everything from installation to application design to deployment, MongoDB In Action is written for the application developer who wants to take advantage of MongoDB and get up and running quickly.",
